# Target Skincare Sales Analysis

##  Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed Target Skincare sales performance in 2024 to uncover insights such as customer purchasing patterns, product performance across locations, and profitability.
I used **Microsoft Excel Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation, and presented the generated insights using the **Power BI** visualization tool to create graphs and charts.

## Files in this Folder
- **Target_Skin_Care - Raw data.csv** → Original dataset before any processing.
- **Target_Skin_Care - Transformed Data.xlsx** → Dataset after wrangling: removing duplicates and errors, formatting and organizing columns.
- **Visualization.png** → Graphs and Charts showing sales trends and top-bottom-performing products.

## Key Insights
- Certain skincare products have high sales but low profit margins.
- Seasonal spikes occur around holidays.
- Specific regions show consistently higher purchase frequency.
