# Target Digital Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

##  Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed Target digital marketing campaign performance across different channels. Through the analysis, I uncovered the ROI to be disproportionate to the advertisement expenditure, signalling a need to better optimize advert expenses towards profitable products. Additonally, I identified Google Ad as the most profitable marketing channel.

## Key Insights
- High Ad Spend and Revenue generation are not matched by equally high ROI, indicating potential inefficiencies in the campaign profitability.
- Certain categories like beverages and personal care, show high impressions but low conversion rates, which suggests issues with targeting.
- Some marketing channels like Google Ads and Referrals have a higher conversion rate than others, driving strategic marketing to increase profit.
